# My Portfolio - Create A Responsive Website With The Use of Grids
## Description of Repository
​
 The My Portfolio repository is the result of a marketing agency wanting their existing codebase to follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized when view by search engines.  The acceptance criteria was based on when the agency views the source code they would find:  

 * A source code consistent with semantic HTML structure. 
 * HTML elements that follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
 * Image element with alt attributes.
 * Heading attributes in sequential order. 
 * A title element with a concise, description title. 

## The Problem With The Original Code Base.
 The codebase presented was heavily riddle with class for form and reliant on a css.style sheet for styling and positioning.

## How It Was Fixed

In order to meet the demands of the clients, the exist code base was analyzed for HTML semantic elements.  After discovering the basic structure was designed with div element and class attributes, semantic html structure was deployed.  For example, certain div elements were convert in it semantic elements in the following order BODY, HEAD, HEADER, SECTIONS 1/HERO, SECTION 2/MAIN SERVICE, SECTION 3/BENEFITS, and FOOTER.  
Each individual change is annotated within the HTML CODE.    

## What I learned

There are always opportunities to refract and consolidate code, and do be affair to rename attribute and classes.
